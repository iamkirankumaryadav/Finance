# Market Cap

- Market capitalization is a key metric used to measure the total value of a publicly traded company's outstanding shares.
- It is calculated by multiplying the current share price by the total number of outstanding shares.
- For example, if a company has 10 million outstanding shares and the current share price is ₹100, the market cap would be ₹1,000 crore.
- Market cap is an essential factor to consider when making investment decisions.
- It provides insights into the company's market value, growth potential, and risk profile. 

### Formula:
Market Cap = Current Share Price x Total Number of Outstanding Shares

### Categories of Market Cap:
1. **Large-Cap**: 
- Companies with a market cap of ₹20,000 crore or more.
- These are well-established companies with a strong market presence (e.g., Reliance Industries, TCS).

2. **Mid-Cap**: 
- Companies with a market cap between ₹5,000 crore and ₹20,000 crore.
- These companies are relatively smaller than large-caps but have significant growth potential (e.g., Mphasis, Voltas).

3. **Small-Cap**: 
- Companies with a market cap of less than ₹5,000 crore.
- These companies are smaller in size and may carry higher risk but offer potential for substantial growth (e.g., TTK Prestige, Deepak Nitrite).

### Importance:
- **Valuation**: Helps investors determine the company's size and value.
- **Comparison**: Allows for comparison among companies within the same industry or across different sectors.
- **Investment Strategy**: Assists investors in choosing their investment strategy based on risk tolerance and investment goals.
